Building GHDL from sources:
***************************

Required:
* the sources of @GCCVERSION@ (at least the core part).
  Note: other versions of gcc sources have not been tested.
* the Ada95 GNAT compiler (GNAT v3.15p and GNAT GPL 2005 are known to work;
  Ada compilers in most Linux distributions are more or less buggy)
* GNU/Linux for ix86 (pc systems) (porting is necessary for other systems)

Procedure:
* untar the gcc tarball
* untar the ghdl tarball (this sould have been done, since you are reading a
  file from it).
* move or copy the vhdl directory of ghdl into the gcc subdirectory of
  the gcc distribution.
  You should have a @GCCVERSION@/gcc/vhdl directory.
* configure gcc with the --enable-languages=vhdl option.  You may of course
  add other languages.
  Refer to the gcc installation documentation.
* compile gcc.
  'make CFLAGS="-O"' is OK (gcc 2.8.1 bugs with -O2 on some files).
* install gcc.  This installs the ghdl driver too.
  'make install' is OK.

Send bugs and comments to ghdl@free.fr.
If you cannot compile, please report the gcc version, GNAT version and gcc
source version.
